			For Denisha, coding is more than just strings of numbers of letters. She has spent her entire life with a love of creative writing (ever since she was seven and wrote and drew her first (and last, 'twas awful) comic called "The Adventures of Bob Blob"), and coding brings that same feeling of enjoyment of creating something out of nothing. She enjoys building and expanding on websites to ensure that whomever is visiting has a user-friendly and informative experience, and if her growing collection of puzzle-platformer games on Steam is any indication, she loves solving puzzles, which web development often entails. She always strives to put herself in the position of being a student, and programming languages are constantly changing and evolving, creating new challenges that she happily takes on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Denisha first developed an early interest in code during her first internship at USA TODAY, where her editor introduced her to front-end web design and content creation with HTML and CSS. The experience proved to be the starting point with her love for code.
		</p>
		<p>
			While attending George Mason University, she continued to hone her skills through various internships at the Newseum and Department of Homeland Security, as well as part-time positions at George Mason University offices, where she voluntarily took on more web content-related responsibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			She graduated from George Mason University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Global Affairs and completed her undergraduate thesis on the effects of digital media and web technologies on the development and globalization of social movements. Her education and experiences in college have cultivated her desire to create new products, as well as to design and build content for the global digital age.
		</p>
		<p>
			Denisha is self-taught in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator, and she honed her coding skills on her own throughout college before enrolling in the New York Code & Design Academy to further her knowledge and skillset of front-end web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			When she isn't coding or enjoying a cup of coffee and a good book, Denisha enjoys traveling, writing horrible poetry and even worse prose, re-creating recipes in Chrissy Teigen's cookbook, ogling the graphics of the newest AAA games, and continuing on her quest to find the perfect cup of coffee.
